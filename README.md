# dltcg-demo
A demo for a game I'm working on with a few friends.

## DISCLAIMER

**This demo is not at all indicative of the final product. This is more a proof-of-concept to get the programming department off their asses and working.**

## How to test

On Windows, run the provided `compfile.cmd` in your terminal
You need to have `raylib` and `gcc` installed, but I would just reccommend going to [the raylib website](https://raylib.com) and downloading it. Comes with a customized installation of Notepad++ (although switching to a different editor is very simple), gcc and all the header files needed.
